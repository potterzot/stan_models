# stan_models

An example repository for using STAN to estimate a bayesian multinomial model of crop mix.


## Useful software:

- [Stan](http://mc-stan.org)
- [Stan example models](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/wiki)
- [rstanarm](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstanarm) - run Stan models via the usual `R` regression syntax.
- [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) - run Stan models via the usual `R` regression syntax, with more options and flexibility.
- [R Bayesian Packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html) - a very long list of `R` resources for bayesian analysis.


## Useful data:

- [USDA Cropland Data Layer](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) - satellite-based estimates of ground cover including crops, forests, urban, etc...
- [USDA Quickstats](quickstats.nass.usda.gov) - myriad agricultural data (also accessible via [rnassqs](https://github.com/potterzot/rnassqs)).
- [SSURGO](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/?cid=nrcs142p2_053627) - Soil survey data.
- [National Resource Inventory](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/technical/nra/nri/) - periodic land use and other data.
- [Census](https://www.census.gov/data.html) - county, state, national level demographic and economic data. Also accessible through [censusapi](https://github.com/hrecht/censusapi)


## Useful books:

- [Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) - A more formal approach but still very helpful and with practical applications.
- [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) - Perhaps the most useful for your typical regression junkie.
- [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) - A hands on from the ground up bayesian statistics text. Also an `R` package `rethinking`. McElreath also has some great [youtube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA/videos).
